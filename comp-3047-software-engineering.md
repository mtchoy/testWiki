## Title (Units): COMP3047 Software Engineering (4,2,3)

## Course Aims: 

This course introduces the methodology of software development as well as the organization, planning and management of the development process so that students will appreciate the difficulties involved in large-scaled software development projects and the importance of a disciplined approach to the problem. At the end of the study of this course, students should be able to

1. conduct requirement analysis,
2. conduct software design to meet the user requirements, develop testing plans, and
3. implement a software solution according to the design specifications.

## Prerequisite:

COMP2015 Data Structures and Algorithms 

## Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs):

Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to:

|No.|Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs)|
|---|--------------------------------------------|
||**Knowledge**|
|1.| Describe the fundamental elements of software development process.|
|2.| Explain how to apply a disciplined methodology to analyze, design and document a software solution.|
|3.| Explain the basic concepts of software implementation and testing.|
||**Professional Skill**|
|4.| Build a software solution through a complete software development life cycle and manage a project in group.|
|5.| Produce a complete technical project report with all stages of a project documented, and make effective oral presentation and demonstration for the project.|
|6.| Develop hybrid mobile applications and dynamic web applications.|

## Calendar Description: 

This course discusses principles and practical aspects of software development. 

## Teaching and Learning Activities (TLAs):

|CILOs | Type of TLA|
|---|-------|
|1-5 | Students will learn the concepts via lectures and in-class exercises.|
|1-6 |Students will be assigned projects and assignments to improve their understanding in the material and to promote their skills and attitudes.|
|4-6 |Students will acquire knowledge and skills on software implementation via guided lab assignments and/or practical tests.|

## Assessment:

|No.| Assessment Methods|Weighting| CILOs to be addressed |Description of Assessment Tasks|
|---|----------------------|----------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
|1| Continuous Assessment| 50% |4-6| Assessments  (e.g., practical test, written or lab-based assignment) are designed to evaluate students’ proficiency.|
|2| Examination| 50% |1-6 |Final examination questions are designed to evaluate how far students have achieved their intended outcomes. Questions will primarily be analysis and skills based to assess students’ ability to apply analysis and design techniques to software development.|
